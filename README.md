# Medical-Data-Visualizer
Medical Data Visualizer Python Data Analysis Project

A Python-based project for analyzing and visualizing medical examination data. This tool uses pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore the relationships between various health indicators like cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, and lifestyle factors.

Dependencies:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

numpy (optional)

pytest (for testing)

This project uses a medical dataset (medical_examination.csv) that includes data on:

Age

Height & Weight

Blood pressure (systolic & diastolic)

Cholesterol & glucose levels

Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity)

Cardiovascular disease (target variable)

Data Processing Highlights
Added an overweight column based on BMI (BMI > 25)

Normalized cholesterol and glucose levels

Removed incorrect or extreme values using logical conditions

Computed correlation matrix and filtered with a mask

earning Objectives
This project is ideal for practicing:

Data wrangling and preprocessing

Feature engineering

Data visualization with seaborn/matplotlib

Statistical analysis with correlation heatmaps
